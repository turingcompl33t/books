## Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future

_Peter Thiel and Blake Masters_

I read this book because my current supervisor reminded me that it existed. I recall Terran Klein mentioning this book from time to time when we were working on Pulse in the early days (I can't remember whether this was to praise or disparage it).

Some key ideas from the book are:

- Thiel introduces a provocative question that he uses in interviews: _what important truth do very few people agree with you on_?
- The necessity of monopoly. There is a strong economic theory emerging from Thiel's teaching. He remarks on the misguided conventional wisdom that perfect competition is the ideal state for an economy. Innovation is not possible under perfect competetition. Innovation is only possible when companies have garnered enough of a monopoly to move past mere survival and take risks that push the entire enterprise forward.
- The risks of pursuing "well-roundedness". This stuck with me because I certainly fell for this ruse in high school and perhaps undergrad, and now I feel as though it has stunted my potential (I also may just like making excuses).
- "indefinite finances". In what Theil describes as an "indefinite world", people prefer opportunity to actual outcomes. This applies to finances as we create a system in which no one actually knows how to use money "productively" (read: for _innovation_) and so we merely move it around endlessly.
- More notes on the education system. The "one-size-does-not-fit-all" argument. Thiel writes that it is not appropriate to expect that the same educational process will "work" for each individual. Therefore, we must take it upon ourselves (to a certain extent?) to educate ourselves and our children well, with a focus on things that will be _valuable_.
- "Academics usually chase a large number of trivial publications instead of new frontiers". This seems like a gross overgeneralization. 
- Every great company has, at its foundation, a secret that it is not willing to share with the rest of the world. The company is a conspiracy to change the world.
- If you aren't forming close personal relationships at work, you are squandering a huge portion of your time without enriching your life.
- Thiel makes a point regarding computers and the way in which they increase productivity without competing with us for resources (yet). This is an interesting factor I have not considered.
- Finally, the "seven questions every business must answer":
    - Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
    - Is now the right time to start your particular business?
    - Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
    - Do you have the right team?
    - Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
    - Will your market position be defensible 10-20 years in the future?
    - Have you identified a unique opportunity that others do not see?

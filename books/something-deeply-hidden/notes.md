## _Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime_

Author: Sean Carroll

### Notes

- Quantum mechanics changed the approach to physics. Prior to quantum mechanics, we were convinced that classical mechanics was a complete description of the way the world worked, and that we were just missing some details. Quantum mechanics revealed that classical mechanics was merely a good approximation for reality.
- Many worlds is the "austere" version of quantum mechanics. It is the minimum viable interpretation that accounts for what we observe in the world. However, as a consequence, we derive some additional phenomena that appear strange.
- Unifying particle and field physics. Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that acheives this. Reality is fundamentcally composed of fields, but when we observe things, we see particles. This is our best understanding of reality so far.
- Einstein described matrix mechanics as being "protected by its own complexity from any proof of its falsity." I love this idea. Beware of shielding your own ideas from ridicule by making them overly-complex.
- Quantum mechanics exposes a fundamental weirdness on reality: there are quantities that do not even exist, yet we can appear to measure them. The uncertainty principle is a manifestation of this fact.
- The uncertainty principle is a result of the behavior of the wave function. The wave function has a dimension for each physical quantity (more or less). When we attempt to localize it along one dimension, the effect is spreading it out over the other dimension.
- The uncertainty principle reflects the difference between what really exists (the quantum states) and what we can measure (one observable at a time). For instance, a qubit that can be measured as a combination of spin-up and spin-down basis, or combination of spin-left and spin-right basis. 
- A measurement in the many worlds interpretation is anything that causes the quantum system to become entangled with its environment. This simplifies the notion of an observation from Cophenhagen.
- Epistemic probability has to do with what we can know from a limited number of trials. 
- We have no right to expect that our concepts and categories that have evolved throughout history should be an accurate description of the way the world actually works. These must be dynamic and subject to change with better scientific understanding.
- The notion of a "world" in many worlds is just a useful abstraction for us to think about. It is not fundamental.
- There is a useful contrast between the simplicity of a physical theory and the simplicity with which it maps onto reality as we observe it. These two values are often in tension?
- Quantum mechanics is not a single theory, it is a framework, much like classical mechanics. It can be used to describe many different physical systems.
